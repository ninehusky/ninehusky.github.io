I've wanted to be good at drawing as long as I can remember.
Funnily enough, this has never translated into me actually putting the
time into seriously learning how to draw. However, I still love to doodle
and sketch, and here are some prolific examples of my clearly untapped talent:

### A scene from Chants of Sennaar (MS Paint, 2025)

My friend June sat me down and we played the demo of this game together.
Critics received this piece well. Dr. Gus Smith says: "I really love the worm guys".

### My impression of my friend [Elliott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elliott-zackrone-757556233/)'s math work (Snapchat, 2024)

We made this at Big Time Brewery -- I was trying to explain to him that he is constantly writing and reading various tomes containing spooky math symbols like these.

I was trying to draw the expression on his face that he makes in all three movies, all the time. I think I got it.

### An interpretation of the Starbucks bee cake pop (MS Paint, 2023)

I don't know why I drew this.

### Nami from League of Legends (Notability, 2022)

I remember I was quarantining because my roommate had COVID when I drew this.

### The Scooby Squad (MS Paint, 2021)

I am almost 100% sure that this was the thing that impressed my girlfriend enough to start dating me.

### A guinea pig (Notability, 2021)

Back when I was a TA for [CSE 142](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse142/22wi/assessments/a8.html),
we had a critters assignment where students would
write classes that simulated behavior of various critters. I drew
this to motivate my esteemed group of TAs to grade the assignment.

### My friend [Sasha](https://turtleshell.me/) at [Cafe Solstice](https://www.instagram.com/cafesolstice/) (MS Paint, 2020)

![Sasha Thomas in a cafe](./assets/art/sasha.png)

In pre-pandemic 2020, Sasha and I were both really miserable all the time, for different reasons.
We would go to Cafe Solstice and just sulk together. I drew this to commemorate our shared misery.

### Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion (MS Paint, 2020)

![Shinji Ikari from Neon Genesis Evangelion](./assets/art/evangelion.jpeg)

I was really into Evangelion for a while -- I don't really know why.
I loved the visuals and the mechs, but I couldn't (and still can't) understand what's going on.
